          <h3>TIULAH ITUM</h3>
          <p class="dark">Translated as " Black Soup " from Bahasa Tausug, This is a native Tausug dish which is also prepared by other Muslim tribes in Mindanao like Yakan, and Sinama..<br>
                This dish is a proof for the Filipino saying - "Sabaw pa lang, Uulam na.. "Tiyulah Itum is a dish which is composed of meat chunks and bones ( Beef, goat meat or chicken meat ) with Burned coconut for its aroma and hot crushed chilis which contributes to its spiciness.<br>
                 It is Black - greenish to dark gray in color due to the burned coconut meat which is unique to the Tausug cuisine. Tiyulah Itum is usually served on ocassions like weddings, Eidil Fitri / Adha, and Duwaa Salamat. I remmember when I had my vacation, my Mom and brother would always serve the family with this dish on our Sahur and Iftar /Bukah. And not a single soup or meat is wasted as it is the Family's favorite dish.  </p>

          <h3>CURACHA</h3>
          <p class="dark">Steam or boil in plain water, until cooked to desired level.  Curacha is best experienced in its natural exotic flavor, cooked minimally so as to preserve its original taste.If you care to add a touch of local flavor to it, mix in some lemongrass and about 3-5 cups of coconut milk to sauce, and boil until done.  Sauce topping could be enhanced with ginger, grated coconut meat, sea salt, pepper, red chilis, and choice vegetables.</p>
